# Design Document for patientTracker

---

## 1. Tech Stack Choices

### a) Frontend Framework
- **Framework Used:** React.js  
- **Why Chosen:**  
  - Efficient for building interactive, responsive single-page applications.
  - Large ecosystem and community support.
  - Component-based architecture promotes reuse and maintainability.
  - Integrates well with RESTful APIs for dynamic data.

### b) Backend Framework
- **Framework Used:** Spring Boot (Java)  
- **Why Chosen:**  
  - Robust and scalable REST API development.
  - Mature ecosystem for security, validation, and database integration.
  - Dependency injection and modularity for maintainable codebases.
  - Good fit for enterprise and data-centric applications.

### c) Database
- **Database Used:** MySQL  
- **Why Chosen:**  
  - Relational model fits users, patients, and files relationships.
  - ACID compliance ensures data integrity and reliability.
  - Well-supported by Spring Boot and easy to manage.

### d) Scaling for 1000+ Users
- **Improvements to Consider:**  
  - Use a database connection pool (e.g., HikariCP) for efficient DB access.
  - Move file storage to cloud (e.g., AWS S3) for better performance and scalability.
  - Add caching (e.g., Redis) for frequent queries.
  - Deploy multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.
  - Optimize database indexing and queries.
  - Use async/background processing for heavy file operations.
  - Implement monitoring and alerting.

## 2. System Flow

### Flow Description (Bullets)
- **Frontend (React):**  
  - User logs in and uploads/downloads documents.
  - Sends authenticated HTTP requests to backend, displays responses and file lists.
- **Backend (Spring Boot):**  
  - Handles authentication, file upload/download, and user-specific queries.
  - Uses Spring Security with JWT for authentication/authorization.
  - Stores uploaded files in a local `uploads` directory.
  - Stores file metadata and user info in MySQL.
- **Database (MySQL):**  
  - Stores users, file metadata, and relationships.
- **File Storage:**  
  - Uploaded PDF files stored in a dedicated folder on the backend server.

### Security Flow

- **Public Routes:**  
  - Routes starting with `/auth` (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`) are public.
- **Private Routes:**  
  - All routes starting with `/api` or others not under `/auth` are private.
  - Private routes require a valid JWT token provided in the `Authorization` header.
  - For each request, Spring Security validates this token:
    - If **valid and not expired**, access is granted.
    - If **invalid or expired**, returns an error (e.g., "Invalid token", "Token expired").
    - If the user tries to access resources not belonging to them, returns **403 Forbidden**.

## 4. Data Flow Description

- The user logs in and is authenticated (session or token).
- User uploads a PDF file via the frontend.
- The frontend sends a multipart/form-data request to the backend with the file.
- Backend validates, saves the file in the `uploads` folder, and records metadata (including user ID) in MySQL.
- When listing files, backend queries MySQL for files belonging to the logged-in user and returns metadata.
- When downloading or deleting, backend **verifies file ownership** before proceeding; only the uploader can download or delete their files.
- For every request to a private route, Spring Security checks the JWT token validity; if invalid/expired, it returns 401 (Unauthorized) or a relevant error. If the user is not the owner of the resource, returns 403 (Forbidden).

---

## 5. Assumptions

- **Authentication:**  
  - Only logged-in users can upload, list, download, or delete documents.
- **Guest Login:**  
  - For local development, a patient account with credentials `guest@gmail.com` / `guest@1234` should be created first in MySQL for initial access and testing.  
  - This user must exist in the DB before other actions can be performed.
- **File Size Limits:**  
  - Maximum upload size is limited via Spring Boot configuration, e.g., 10MB.
- **File Types:**  
  - Only PDF uploads are accepted for security and standardization.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - All endpoints return clear error messages and HTTP status codes.
  - Attempting to access or delete files not uploaded by the current user returns a 403 Forbidden error.
  - Invalid or expired JWT tokens return appropriate authentication errors.
- **File Storage:**  
  - Files are stored in a local `uploads` directory for development; can migrate to cloud for production.
- **User Data:**  
  - Each file is associated with a user; **only the owner can view, download, or delete their files**.
